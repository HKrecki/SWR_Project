A project carried out as part of a master's thesis.
Subject: Robotized Station for Testing the Parameters of Spot Welding.
Main assumptions: Realization of an independent sensors network that allows monitoring the parameters and quality of the spot welding process.
Components and technologies: 
STM32G4 (C language) + analog sensors (Hall sensors, photoresistors vibration sensors) + data visualization in STM32CubeMonitor
STM32F4 (C language) + thermal imaging camera (MLX90640) + camera image visualization (Python)
